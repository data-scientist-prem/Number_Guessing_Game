# Number Guessing Game in C

This is a mini-project written in C where the user plays a **Number Guessing Game**. The game randomly generates a number between 0 to 100, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. The game starts by asking the user to choose a **difficulty level**:
   - **Easy**: 15 guesses
   - **Normal**: 10 guesses
   - **Hard**: 5 guesses

2. The computer then randomly selects a number between **0 to 100**.

3. The user is prompted to guess the number. For each guess:
   - The game provides hints like *"Lower the number please!"* or *"Higher the number please!"*
   - It also displays the **remaining attempts** after each guess.

4. If the user runs out of attempts, the game ends with a **"Game Over"** message.

5. After each game session, the user is asked if they would like to **play again**.

6. The game also includes **input validation** to ensure valid entries for menu choices and number guesses.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have a C compiler like **GCC** installed.

To compile and run the game:

```bash
gcc number_guessing_game.c -o game
./game
.
```

# 📚 What I Learned
This was one of my first C language projects. Apart from practicing loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation in C, I also learned:

How to implement input validation to prevent crashes.

The value of using AI tools like **ChatGPT** to debug, optimize, and enhance project features.

How to turn basic code into an interactive, user-friendly game.
